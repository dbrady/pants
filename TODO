- Specs, dangit

- Authentication

  - Simple: I'd like to be able to log into my own blog. This would
    enable exotic features like moderating, editing, and my personal
    favorite: being able to post.

  - More complicated: Allow users to sign up with a confirmation
    email, set their profile and gravatar, recover password. BLEAH,
    this is starting to sound like work/bloat.

- Posts aren't filtered by published_at date yet. If you put an
  unpublished post in the database, it will show up immediately.
